OxygenLevels is my very first mod for The Long Dark. It introduces a mechanic that simulates oxygen deprivation based on the player's altitude.

This mod adjusts stamina regeneration rate, stamina and fatigue consumption during sprints, and fire starting, based on 4 altitude levels relative to the player's altitude. *It also adds some fun stuff at the last level c:*

I'll try to make an Oxygen Mask / Oxygen Tank to prevent the effects of altitude in the future (Soon™ trust).

It's also translated in 6 differents languages : English, French, German, Spanish, Turkish and Russian. Please feel free to contact me if any translation seems strange or incorrect, I'll correct it.

Highly customizable, the mod requires ModSettings and ModComponent to work.
